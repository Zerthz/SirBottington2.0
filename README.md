# SirBottington2.0

The refactored version of my first Discord bot using Discord .NET.
The first bot was written when I was just learning how to code in C#, it thus had horrible design choices and structure. Since then I've learnt a lot and hopefully improved somewhat. The code as it is is ofcourse not perfect but atleast an improvement.

Features from the old bot that has yet to be ported over are
* Roulette system
* The ATM for account credits
